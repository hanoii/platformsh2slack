# Platform.sh -> Slack incoming webhook adapter

This is a simple php script that translates [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) webhook into a [Slack](http://slack.com/)
formatted message.

You can install this in your php app container and host it there for your project's specific webhooks.

## Installation

You can install the package using the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager. You can install it by running this command in your project root:

```sh
composer require hanoii/platformsh2slack
```

Then [create an incoming webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook) on your Slack account for the package to use. You'll need the webhook URL to instantiate the adapter.

## Basic Usage

```php
<?php

// Optional settings
$settings = [
  'channel' => '#random',
  'project' => 'Some project',
  // Environment will be appended to the URL
  'project_url' => 'https://console.platform.sh/USER/PROJECTID',
];

$platformsh2slack = new Hanoii\Platformsh2Slack\Platformsh2Slack(
  'https://hooks.slack.com/...',
  $settings
);

// Optionally protect the request with a token that has to be present in the Platform.sh webhook
$platformsh2slack->validateToken('1234');

// Send the information to slack
$platformsh2slack->send();
```

## Platform.sh build hook

If your application (`.platform.app.yaml`) is already being built with composer:

```yaml
build:
    flavor: composer
```

You can simply add:

```json
    "hanoii/platformsh2slack": "^1.0"
```

To your `composer.json` file of the project and create a small script as per above.

If not, you will have to add a script to the repository and run composer install on your build hook manually.

## Settings

Option | Type | Default | Description
----- | ---- | ------- | -----------
`channel` | string | `null` | The default channel that messages will be sent to, otherwise defaults to what's set on the Slack's incoming webhook
`commit_limit` | int | `10` | The number of commits from the payload to include in the Slack message 
`routes` | bool | `false` | Whether to show project's routes on every slack message. If false, it will be shown only when you branch.
`redirects` | bool | `false` | Whether to include project's redirects with routes on every Slack message. If false, redirects will be shown only when you branch.
`basic_auth` | bool | `false` | Whether to show project environment's HTTP Authentication username and password in Slack message.  WARNING: If true, potentially sensitive data passwords will be sent in the clear to your Slack channel.
`configurations` | bool | `false` | Whether to show project's configurations on every slack message. If false, it will be shown only for master when you push, merge or have a subscription plan update.
`attachment_color` | string | `'#e8e8e8'` | RGB color for Slack attachment.
`project` | string | `null` | If present, it will be used as the project title instead of the default.
`project_url` | string | `null` | If present, the project title will link to this URL instead of the default for Slack notifications. Environment branch will be appended automatically to the URL. If empty, the default project link will be used: `https://console.platform.sh/project/{project_id}`.
`debug` | string | `null` | An optional path where posssible unhandled webhooks JSON can be saved. This is useful if you want to send over the json for me to add support for it.
`debug_all` | boolean | `false` | If `debug` is set, it saves the JSON of every webhook sent, not only the unhandled ones.
`active` | boolean | `false` | If `active` is set, only webhooks of active environments will be sent to platform. Useful for some external integrations.

## Token

This is an optional feature you can choose to use on the script. It's a nice simple validation so that you script is not abused.

If you added:

```php
$platformsh2slack->validateToken('1234');
```

to your script, you will have to append the token the Platform.sh's webhook integration URL.

## Add the integration on platform

Run the following:

```bash
platform integration:add --type=webhook --url="https://www.example.com/platformsh2slack.php?token=TOKEN"
```

## Environoments

You can have this script on any environment, even master. As far as my trials went, even pushing to master works.
